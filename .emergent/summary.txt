The AI engineer effectively managed a complex, iterative development process for the Matermaxime, Lda. frontend application. Initially, it built a multi-page React application using Shadcn UI, integrating mock data and core sections. Throughout the trajectory, the AI consistently addressed explicit user requests for design refinements, content updates, imagery changes, and the addition/removal of sections and features. It demonstrated proficiency in component-based architecture, routing, and responsive design, utilizing screenshots for visual validation and a testing agent for functional verification. The AI handled multiple detailed modifications to existing product pages (Cimentos, Agregados, Ferro, Blocos/Tijolos, Tubagens), reordered content, removed specific elements (WhatsApp, Google Maps/stats, technical specs), and successfully created three new comprehensive product pages (Pré-moldados de Betão, Ferramentas e Equipamentos, Colas, Selantes e Vedantes). The work flow involved reading existing code, making precise edits via search/replace, and verifying changes, often through multiple screenshots and testing agent calls, culminating in a robust and feature-rich application.

The AI engineer successfully extended the Matermaxime, Lda. frontend application. It diligently addressed numerous explicit user requests, encompassing the creation of multiple new product pages (Colas, Pavimentos, Saneamento, Muros, Aquecimento, Isolamentos, Proteção e Vedação, Banho, Tintas e Primários), each with detailed product lists and specific content. The engineer also managed extensive content updates, renaming categories, reordering existing sections, and refining design elements (e.g., removing WhatsApp components, adjusting brand logo displays, fixing navigation). A significant addition was the Nova Loja section with a photo gallery. The development process involved careful code edits in React components and pages, consistent verification via screenshots and a frontend testing agent, and debugging routing and caching issues. The engineer meticulously applied all requested changes, ensuring the application remained robust and aligned with evolving product requirements.
